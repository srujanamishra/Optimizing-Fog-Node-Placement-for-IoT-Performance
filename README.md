# Optimizing-Fog-Node-Placement-for-IoT-Performance
This project analyzes how increasing fog nodes in IoT networks affects delay. Using smart agriculture and smart city scenarios, we find that delay reduces initially but plateaus or worsens due to overhead. The goal is to optimize fog node count for better performance and resource use.
